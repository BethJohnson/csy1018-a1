    <h1 class="Title8">About Me</h1>
    <h4 class="Description4">
      Hi, My Name is Bethany Johnson and I am 18 years old.
      At this stage of my life I am studying at the University of Northampton as a first year BSc Computing student.
    Before studying at the University of Northampton I had been studying ICT for 2 years seriously which is where I discovered my passion for the subject.

                 <!--Second Section: about my degree-->
    <h2 class="Title9"> My Degree</h2>
    <h5 class="Description5"> As a first year my course is currently filled with six modules spanning all areas of computing from Networking to Web Development.
    As a general computing student my next two years will consist of covering more areas of computing as well as developing the skills
    I have already obtained.</h5>
                    <!--Third Section: about my first commission-->
    <h3 class="Title10">My First Set of Commissioned Work</h3>
    <h6 class="Description6"> In November 2016 I recieved my first commission which I readily accepted. It consisted of creating a new logo, and documentation for'Finnestra' a sub-company of 'Simplicity Blinds'.
    This was a good chance for me to practise time managment successfully as I had to manage univeristy work and this project.
    I eventually received a call from the owners of the company, my clients, who were impressed with my work and requested that I also take on another project.
    This task involved the same concept as the intial commission with one large difference...They wished for me to re-invent their main business logo/documentation.
    From this project I once again recieved another projec from them on top of the two previous commissions, this time for business cards for the main company.</h6>
  <h7 class="Description7"> The main issues I encountered with the project were that I had only touched upon Graphic Design as a self-taught hobby but luckily this only hindered my confidence not my clients.
    The other main issue I encountered was that I had never created business cards before and was not aware of the current standards for proffessional business cards.
    I contacted my client and obtained their previous card as well as doing some research into other layouts of business cards but found them all very different.
    As a reuslt I decided to use the same information as their previous card but give it a completely new look with the idea of using opposites. Where they used a darker background I went instead for lighter backgrounds in my designs etc.
